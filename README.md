# Getting Started with React Animals APP


This app is created to understand basics of React and maintaining state in React using state hooks.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app allows to add the random Animal when you click on ADD Animal Button. It also allows to like the animal. The more number of likes the larger the heart icon.
